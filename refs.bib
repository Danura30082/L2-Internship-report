abstract = {A new UV submersible spectroradiometer has been employed to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance in the clearest natural waters $Kw(\lambda)$ with emphasis on the spectral region from 300 to 400 nm. Kw($\lambda$) can be related to the inherent optical properties of pure water, in particular the total absorption coefficient aw($\lambda$) and the molecular scattering coefficient bm($\lambda$), by means of equations derived from radiative transfer theory. We present an analysis showing that limiting values of Kw($\lambda$) can be estimated from aw($\lambda$) and vice versa. Published aw($\lambda$) data, which show discrepancies much larger than their estimated accuracies, are briefly reviewed and then compared, via our analysis, with Kw($\lambda$) data (our own new and previously published data as well as relevant data of others). This comparative analysis and new data allow a consistent and accurate set of optical properties for the clearest natural waters and for pure fresh water and saltwater to be estimated from 300 to 800 nm.},
